A Windows tray application that simulates the "Add folder to taskbar" functionality. It allows you to access your favorite folders quickly from the system tray with a modern, customizable menu.

## Features
-   **System Tray Integration**: Access folders via a tray icon.
-   **Folder Navigation**: Browse files and subfolders in a hierarchical menu.
-   **Open Folder**: Double click to open folders.
-   **Right Click Menu**: Right click a file to open the right-click menu just like the file explorer.

## Getting Started
1.  Download the latest release.
2.  Run `TrayFolder.exe`.
3.  Right-click the tray icon to configure your root folder.

## How to Keep Icon Visible
By default, Windows might hide the tray icon in the overflow menu. To keep it always visible on the taskbar:
1.  Click the "Show hidden icons" arrow (^) in the system tray.
2.  Drag the **TrayFolder** icon from the overflow menu to the main taskbar area.
